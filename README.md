Simple frame extractor for video dataset
=======================================

[notice]

This is simple frame extractor 

I use it for our lab's dataset but this is now public dataset yet.

So I test this code to famouse benchmark dataset for human action recognition (HMDB-51 dataset).

And it worked well.
